# CS_ScienceTreeToDrawio
This tool allows you to visualize a science.json file from Colony Survival (either vanilla or modded) within draw.io / diagrams.net, providing a representation similar to common videogame tech trees.

Usage:
1. Copy the science.json from your mod or from Colony Survival\gamedata\baseconfig to the directory containing the to_xml.py script.
2. Open the copied science.json and remove the comment at the beginning of the document. It starts with /* and ends with */.
3. Execute the to_xml.py script.
4. Open draw.io / diagrams.net
5. Choose the "Open from..." option and select your local PC. Then, upload the output.xml file.
6. Your science tree will be displayed!
Note: The current visualization might not be perfectly organized, so manual rearrangement might be needed for optimal presentation.
